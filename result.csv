Dinesh,5.0,Good Mobile (If you have budget go for it. don't buy to impress or on EMI (not worth it)),2024-01-29,"As I was aware that what I need and what I was paying for, I needed a quality mobile with best hardware and software combination.
I need the OS to be clean without any bloatware which I got.
I don't play games. For moderate use of Social media, whatsapp, youtube, audible (audio books), music while exercising, Battery life is around 2 days or sometimes more than 2 days. If you are a gamer or use mobile a lot you might need to charge your mobile everyday.
Camera is good. So far the pictures I took the quality is good.
Not explore the processor's capacity yet but Never hanged or never will for me (not a heavy user so won't be a problem).",Positive
rs1008,5.0,Amazing Lightning fast phone,2023-12-03,The phone is really good it had some overheating issue as heard but not faced any it was due to software update now it is all fixed I still did not had any issue regarding overheating. The phone is really fast and the battery life is awesome. The new action button is really handy and useful. The camera is the best camera an iPhone ever had the photos are stunning and spectacular…. I am satisfied with the phone..,Positive
Placeholder,5.0,The best phone to show that you are doing great,2024-02-04,"A phone that screams that you are doing very well for yourself. Don’t get me wrong, it works extremely well and I am completely satisfied with it. but, it is way too expensive for a phone. I have a pixel 8 which as a secondary phone which costs way less and I am satisfied with that as well. Nevertheless, nothing can replace an iPhone for me due to personal preferences",Positive
Abban Rehmat,4.0,Incremental Upgrade with Enhanced Camera,2024-01-25,"I recently upgraded to the Apple 15 Pro Max, and while the enhanced camera is undoubtedly impressive, but I feel that it falls short of delivering a truly groundbreaking experience. If you're already using the 13 pro or 14 Pro, there seems to be little incentive to make the leap.

The camera improvements are noteworthy, capturing detail and clarity like never before. However, beyond this feature, the 15 Pro Max doesn't offer a significant leap in terms of innovation. Personally, I find the Pro versions more manageable in hand, and the Max variant, although boasting a larger screen, can be a bit unwieldy.

In essence, the 15 Pro Max is a solid device with a stellar camera, but for those already enjoying the perks of the previous Pro models, the upgrade might not feel as compelling.",Positive
Chankey,5.0,Best Smart Phone ever,2023-11-19,"It’s a fantastic phone…the feel and comfort in hand is awesome…looks stunning…also the brand appeal of Apple is fabulous. Camera is the best, performance is over the top…really fast and the games you can play are of play station’s…can any other phone do that…also the video quality is very nice…",Positive

If you need an iPhone with 24-26hr battery life on a single charge then go for Pro Max models. No doubt Apple's 4K 60fps ProRes is really awesome, and the all new type-c port is the best thing Apple has done in years. Also all the type-c cables included in the box are woven design, now expecting this will not turn grey after few months of use.",Positive

Aditya Dubey,4.0,A High end phone for heavy tasks and security.,2024-02-02,"The iPhone 15 pro max is the latest flagship smartphone from Apple, and it offers some impressive features and performance. I have been using it for a month now, and here are my thoughts on it.

Design and Display
The iPhone 15 pro max has a sleek and elegant design, with a stainless steel frame and a ceramic shield glass back. It is available in four colors: silver, graphite, gold, and pacific blue. The phone is water and dust resistant, and it supports wireless charging and MagSafe accessories.

The display is a 6.7-inch OLED screen, with a resolution of 2778 x 1284 pixels and a refresh rate of 120 Hz. The screen is bright, sharp, and smooth, and it supports HDR10 and Dolby Vision. The notch at the top houses the Face ID sensor and the 12 MP selfie camera.

Camera and Battery
The iPhone 15 pro max has a triple rear camera system, consisting of a 12 MP wide-angle lens, a 12 MP telephoto lens, and a 12 MP ultra-wide-angle lens. The camera can capture stunning photos and videos, with optical image stabilization, 5x optical zoom, night mode, portrait mode, and 4K video recording at 60 fps. The camera also supports LiDAR scanning, which enables faster autofocus and better depth sensing.

The battery life of the iPhone 15 pro max is excellent, as it can last for a whole day of heavy usage. The phone supports fast charging, and it can reach 50% charge in 30 minutes with a 20W adapter. The phone also supports wireless charging and MagSafe charging, which can deliver up to 15W of power.

Performance and Software
The iPhone 15 pro max is powered by the A15 Bionic chip, which is the most advanced processor in the market. The chip has a six-core CPU, a five-core GPU, and a 16-core neural engine. The phone can handle any task or app with ease, and it delivers smooth and fast performance. The phone has 6 GB of RAM and comes in three storage options: 128 GB, 256 GB, and 512 GB.

The iPhone 15 pro max runs on iOS 15, which is the latest version of Apple's operating system. iOS 15 offers many new features and improvements, such as widgets, app library, picture-in-picture, app clips, and more. iOS 15 also enhances the privacy and security of the phone, with features like app tracking transparency, sign in with Apple, and Face ID.

Conclusion
The iPhone 15 pro max is a premium and powerful smartphone, that offers a great user experience. The phone has a beautiful design and display, a superb camera and battery, and a blazing-fast performance and software. The phone is expensive, but it is worth the money for anyone who wants the best of the best. I would highly recommend the iPhone 15 pro max to anyone who is looking for a high-end smartphone.",Positive

Nuaa Rawat,5.0,Beast Gadget with PROS CONS,2023-11-06,"Pros :
Light weighted ~ My XR weighted more than pro max. It is lighter.
Good performance ~ Very smooth
Good battery life ~ I charged it 100% at 3 PM now after lazy use it is at 61% at 10.30 PM and Next day till 3.33 PM it is at 18%, which is quite good.

Also 5G works good, in my XR there were hardly any networks but it’s antenna is really good. 5G works like a charm.

Cons :
Heating was there in 16.0.x but fixed in 17.0.1, in 16.0.x it heats up around cam area at the top mainly.

Now after the fix,

It heated up in 30-40% charging, then heated up again in 70%, at 80% it is cool, and at 100% it was cool. Which is normal, trust me all iPhones heats up, even my XR heats up but is not observable because of the phone cover.

Battery took around 2 hours to charge(my battery was at 6% I put up on charging around 1 PM and at 2.45 or 3 PM it was around 100% now I have set the limit to 80% for good battery life)

Later at around 100% battery when I used basic app, it heats up a little around cam area but the heat is very minor. Since I am not using any cover so I felt it.

Overall after the fix, the heating is resolved completely, so you can be assured in this area.

Battery backup is quite good, I am using 80% optimised battery option and y’day night I charged it and today till 8.26 PM it is at 27%, I watched video, shopping apps, social media apps heavily.

It keeps a check of your battery charging cycle, since I’m using 80% Limit, the charging has fasten up, it usually takes 35-40 min for 80% and then after it slows down the charging.

Durability : I have checked few reviews, the back panel is weak it has high chances of breaking, the front glass is strong but could get scratches.

USE COVERS AND TEMPERED. Overall for apple users, it is a beast in performance. Do not panic if this gets heats up, it is an APP and OS issue.

I’m observing the apps and OS and the heating area but it is doing brilliant so far.

Cam Quality : I am not liking the front camera pictures, it actually overdo the image, you might not like Selfies but there are plenty of options for video and camera. You can shoot in 4K and Raw max, etc.
I’m not a selfie lover so it is kinda okay for me but you will def not like the after camera processing selfie image.

Sound Quality: The best, superior DOLBY sound quality. I haven’t heard this much of brilliant sound in any of the devices in recent times. Decent sound..!! You will love the music and AV.

FYI : It fell down from a meter height but since I had a good case so nothing happened luckily. pls make sure you have a good cover. I saw videos the back panel is weak due to different assembly in this series.

PS : I’m not a heavy user. I don't play games, so cannot review on the heat and battery while playing games.",Positive
